- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @KujoKajen, my name was taken, I have 3 aliases Reckon, Kujo, Kajen
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in sharing, living, eating, good stuff and enjoy new things..most of the time.
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning how to use GitHub, to share DayZ editor files, map builds, Ai setups
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to be successful in helping others have fun on any size server and in everyday life.
   How to reach me discord channel: Shade of Life
  Where there is Shade let there be life.
  The greatest Essence of all, is yours. Knowing "We" are all part of the, Essence of everything.

 I just joined github today 3-30-2025. I have a youtube channel that I share tutorials/hints ect and game play on
as well as other things I record while testing edits/builds. YouTube channel is : Kujo's Place
It's the one with DayZ BlackOut Corvette pictured, I noticed I am not the only Kujo's Place on youtube.
I will be sharing files from the DayZ Editor .dze, .json, .xml.
Later, DayZ Expansion Ai, DayZ Dynamic Ai Addon - settings as well most likely.
Provided I can figure this all out. I am still learning/absorbing what I can. The Editor I am really new at.
The Ai - used in DayZ Expansion and DayZ Dynamic Ai Addon have a lot of settings and a wonderful github for information
on those settings. What I will be sharing is my own personal settings so you can just copy and paste
them into your files so you don't have to gather cords for them and will not know exactly where all
the Ai are located without tracking the numbers/cordinates from the files. It will add to the
fun and excitement of runniing the maps on your own servers (Surprises). I am currently running 5 small servers.
all of which are open to the public so join them and check out what is being worked on and find what is completed.

The following three server providers have percentage discounts for renting for a longer period of time. 
(Costs may change and these are just what I paid prior to 3-30-2025.. following the notes/my opinions on them. 
Followed by the name of my server/s and their ip's :  here is the break down :
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
https://www.gtxgaming.co.uk/

GTX Game server account $37 for 3 mths 10 pop server nicer pricing for higher pop servers and a very nice gamepanel to work from.
Just always backup your server files, they have a glitch between Steam and DayZ updates that reverts some back to original settings
that the other providers do not because the others are setup for you to do manually. So any time you make changes to any settings in 
your files make a backup.
("Highly Recommend for larger pop servers the price lowers for higher pops instead of doubling 10 pop was $13.?? 20 pop was $17.?? 
something a month".)

Server name: GTX Test Build : ip 69.10.59.26:2302   

(I am running a Death Match, my own build on the Chernarus Map PVP v/s Ai. Watch the videos on youtube: Kujo's Place)
It's called the "Iron Horse". (.dze,.xml,.json are free to download just enjoy what you do with it.)(It has areas at both ends for 
base defencive stratigies/theme.) (Remember the files will only give you the ability to add the build not the Ai. You can also open
them an edit the existing build. No permission needed on any of the DayZ Editor files shared on my github.)

----------------------------------------------------------
https://pingplayers.com/

PingPlayers ($13.06 per mth, for each 10 pop, increases the same for each 10, 20 pop would be $26.12, 30 pop $39.18 ect.
(They have the BEST SUPPORT of the three sevice providers, online chat nearly instant responces during business hours !! )
(A nicer game panel then Nitrado's web portal, and that help chat window is awesome.)
(After using Nitrado for years it took a bit to figure PingPlayers server panel out but it was worth the extra time.)
(Look for promo codes for PingPlayers I paid 50 cents for the first month and $1.25 for the second.!! Nice.)

Server name : Kujo's Playground : ip 79.127.242.122:11255  (10 pop)

(PNW BUILD loaded with Ai, check out the video's on youtube at Kujo's Place 
If your interested in the files for the Ai or the DayZ Editor dze file for the ship build and the island build,
subscribe to Kujo's Place, join my discord channel : Shade of Life 
Just make a comment about it.
I will add them here when I figure this all out.) 

Sever name : Testing DayZ : ip 79.127.232.37:11250   10 pop ( tbh idk whats happening on this server atm )

--------------------------------
https://server.nitrado.net/en-US

Nitrado : (Least favorite of the three server providers same cost for just an 8 pop as a 10 pop on other providers 
and not as user friendly). They use to be the least expencive at $3.69 per month for a 4 pop server, 
they do not provide 4 pop server, or so they say now. (TBH, I still am running a 4 pop account that belongs to a 
friend that got me started playing DayZ and messing around with adding mods that led to all this. Auto renewal so
it never got shut down, 3 years running on that server.)

Server name : heywire|Death|Race|2025  (NOTE: 4 pop server)

(Chenarus map, castle wall course all kinds of vehicles, ramps and Ai trying to stop you from completing the lap. 
1 lap takes aprox 1 hour, course record just a bit over 40 minutes since updates with castle walls to keep you 
on course. Spawn into an area full of vehicles jump in and go. Your welcome to build a base on this server.)

Server name : Dayz Editor Builds : ip 134.255.214.46:11500  (8 pop) (I thinnk this is my Enoch/Livonia build in progress.)

Server name : Pikehunter : ip 134.255.214.154:10700  (8 pop) 

This is a tutorial server where we can give you permissions, we can go through the basics of using different things 
related to DayZ gaming, admin tools, and things that are easier to show in game over discord voice on Shade of Life 
It requires the use of your steam id which is openly shared everytime you log into any game server anyway.
It just needs to be implemented into the server files to grant you permissions to use the tools.

(Join Discord: Shade of Life and watch Pikehunter's youtube channel: WastedDayZ
or catch him in game on Neo Farmers server 192.96.219.145:2302 he spends a lot of time there.) 
----------------------------------

An upcoming shoutout to try your skill at the following GTX server. A group of friends asked me to help setup a server
and kept changing the theme so I parted ways with the server help, hopefully no hard feelings have come of it. I am still
willing to provide offline help, voice chat and map edits/addons just not willing to continue server settings related to
different mods I am not familiar with and do not use on my servers. I may look into those mods just to become more familiar
over time and have already shared a bit of video that may provide some help to them or who ever is helping them.. hopefully
they have a coder now that knows VPP like I know a deck of cards. idk everything there is to know about VPP and it is a
a good admin tool. Just note that its the RECON pw on your server that you need to use for logging into the system after 
logging into the VPP tool in game. 

Anyway check it out if your into Death Match

Server name: Fully Cooked: 1PP Vanilla DayZ Deathmatch
Address: 205.209.104.180:2302
Server version: 1.27.159586
Required game version: 1.27.0

Map: Livonia
Mission: Deathmatch in Livonia
Players: 30/30
